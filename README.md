# Adventure time!
A custom 404 page - which is in fact a text adventure - for my home page [csokavar.hu](https://csokavar.hu). 
The site has a few hidden items to discover and a text adventure felt like a nice addition. 
I aimed to bring back the feel of the classic genre for the 5 minutes one might want to spend on it.

The game starts with the mistic (or corny?) `- Ouch, that hurts! What's this darkness? Where is everyone?` question and the player is expected to investigate the situation. 
It may sound banal, but consider it as a little parody made with ❤️.

The game is written in TypeScript, and you interact with it with the classic verb + object style. 
Io is delegated to [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/) for authenticity. 
It's not really a webapp, but I used [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to avoid playing whack-a-mole with the bundling issues that always come up at the beginning of these projects.

## Getting Started
You can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `docs` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
